# Implementation Summary Rule

For every significant implementation or change:

- Document a summary of what was done in the implementation.
- Clearly state what worked and what did not work during the process.
- Use concise, clear language and bullet points where appropriate.
- Store these summaries in a dedicated file or section for easy reference.
- Reference any relevant files using the `[filename.ext](mdc:filename.ext)` format as per Cursor rules.
- implement then ask me if its okay , dont stop after doing one thing

This ensures transparency, knowledge sharing, and easier debugging or future improvements.
