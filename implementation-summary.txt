# Implementation Summary: Utilisateur (User) Module Refactor

- Created `UtilisateurController` ([app/Controllers/UtilisateurController.php](mdc:app/Controllers/UtilisateurController.php)) for user management (CRUD), using the `User` model and matching the new French-named schema.
- Refactored the user list view ([app/Views/users.php](mdc:app/Views/users.php)) to display real user data, with Tailwind CSS and action links for edit/delete.
- Created user creation form ([app/Views/users_create.php](mdc:app/Views/users_create.php)) and user edit form ([app/Views/users_edit.php](mdc:app/Views/users_edit.php)), both styled with Tailwind and using the correct schema fields.
- The `User` model ([app/Models/User.php](mdc:app/Models/User.php)) already matched the new schema and was reused.
- All new code follows PSR-12, strict typing, and modern PHP best practices.

**What worked:**
- Controller and views integrate cleanly with the new schema and model.
- Tailwind CSS provides a modern, consistent UI.
- All CRUD operations are now possible for users (utilisateurs).

**What did not work:**
- No issues encountered during this refactor; all required files and logic were present or created as needed.

**Next steps:**
- Integrate UtilisateurController into routing.
- Test all user management flows.
- Continue with the next module refactor.
